# Ambient Chess
My first project made in Unity. Had a lot of fun making this. It's not perfect but I'm happy with how it turned out!
The links to the full build (Executable and all) can be found [here](https://mega.nz/folder/n2ImFJYY#rRHYxME5dPP2ooOfYE9z7w) as well as in the "Builds" folder in the repository.

Let me know if you have any suggestions I'll consider adding them in the future! :)
