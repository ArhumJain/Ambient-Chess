# Ambient Chess
My first project made in Unity. Had a lot of fun making this. It's not perfect but I'm happy with how it turned out!
The links to the full build (Executable and all) can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h3jvnVIgPuPQZt2E5ZwU9OEjgskHvrPB?usp=sharing) (Google Drive).

Let me know if you have any suggestions I'll consider adding them in the future! :)
